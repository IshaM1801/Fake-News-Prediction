# 📰 Fake News Detection with Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **Fake News Detection** model built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning**. The model is trained to classify news articles as real or fake based on their content.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset consists of news articles labeled as **real (0)** or **fake (1)**.
- It includes the following columns:
  - `id` - Unique identifier for the article
  - `title` - The title of the article
  - `author` - The author of the article
  - `text` - The full article text
  - `label` - `1` (Fake) or `0` (Real)
- Data preprocessing includes **text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization** using **TF-IDF**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine Learning models
- **NLTK** - Text preprocessing
- **Pandas & NumPy** - Data handling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
 cd fake-news-detection
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
